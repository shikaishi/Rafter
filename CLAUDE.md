# CLAUDE.md — Rafter Platform

---

## Session Protocol

This file is the single source of truth for the Rafter project. Read it in full at the start of every session.

**Claude Chat:** Will pastes this file at session start. Claude Chat coordinates all work — writes prompts for Code and Cowork, reviews outputs, decides next actions.

**Claude Code:** Read CLAUDE.md before every task. Update it after completing work — close issues, update status, add new findings. Push to GitHub after updating.

**Cowork:** Maintains CLAUDE.md between sessions. When instructed, edits in place and pushes to GitHub. Does not rewrite the whole file — targeted edits only.

**Never create new tracker or log files. Everything lives in CLAUDE.md. No Google Sheets. No duplicate files.**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY RULE

**NEVER use Andy's live ServiceM8 UUID during development or testing.**

| Instance | UUID | Use |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Trial (DEV/TEST)** | `448e12a8-f7d9-4ace-b8c6-242bf678db3b` | All development and testing |
| **Andy's live (PRODUCTION)** | `0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b` | T1-F2 only — explicit sign-off required |

If you are about to write code referencing the live UUID, stop and confirm with Will first.

# SECTION 1 — Project Overview

## What Rafter is

Rafter is an AI-assisted quoting and operations platform for Australian tradespeople, built by
Deep Green Sea Pty Ltd (Will Thurlow). It generates branded PDF quotes from a web form,
creates jobs in ServiceM8, and emails the quote PDF to the customer.

**First client:** Andy — 2 Men and a Shovel, Melbourne landscaper.
**Deep Green Sea entity:** Will Thurlow, ABN TBD, deepgreensea.au.
**GitHub:** shikaishi/Rafter (private)
**Platform URL:** rafter.deepgreensea.au
**SM8 operator email (Andy's instance):** will@deepgreensea.au
**Trial/dev email:** will@thurlow.net
**SM8 App ID:** 781230

```

**CRITICAL deployment rules:**
- Never put `wrangler.toml` at repo root. No HTML files at repo root. The `workers/rafter/`
  Worker serves the site — deploy manually from that subdirectory.
- All Workers deploy manually: `cd workers/<name> && npx wrangler deploy`
- Cloudflare git auto-deploy is disabled (build command = `exit 0`).

## Cloudflare infrastructure

| Resource | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Site Worker | `rafter` — rafter.deepgreensea.au (custom domain) |
| materials-sync Worker | `rafter-materials-sync` — rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev |
| pdf Worker | `rafter-pdf` — rafter-pdf.will-8e8.workers.dev |
| R2 bucket | `rafter-assets` |
| KV namespace | `RAFTER_CLIENTS` |
| KV namespace ID | `7c7ad02d8136452eb6d03d1af89a684f` |
| KV binding in wrangler.toml | `binding = "RAFTER_CLIENTS", id = "7c7ad02d8136452eb6d03d1af89a684f"` |

**KV tooling notes:**
- Wrangler v4 `kv key list` returns `[]` — use Cloudflare dashboard or REST API to browse keys.
- **Never** use `wrangler kv key put "key" $value` from PowerShell — it corrupts JSON. Always
  write JSON to a UTF-8 file first, then: `npx wrangler kv key put "key" --path file.json --binding=RAFTER_CLIENTS --remote`
- Run all `wrangler` commands from `workers/materials-sync/`.

## Worker — rafter (site)

**URL:** https://rafter.deepgreensea.au  
**Location:** `workers/rafter/`  
**Type:** Worker with Assets (`not_found_handling = "single-page-application"`)

Serves static HTML files. Slug-based routing: `rafter.deepgreensea.au/{slug}` reads the first URL
path segment and resolves it to a client UUID via `/resolve-slug/{slug}` on rafter-materials-sync.

**Worker secrets:**  
*(none — site is static HTML)*

## Worker — rafter-materials-sync

**URL:** https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev  
**Location:** `workers/materials-sync/`

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | None | Status check |
| `/store-token` | POST | Bearer `RAFTER_WORKER_SECRET` | Write OAuth tokens to KV after Account Discovery |
| `/client-config?uuid={uuid}` | GET | `x-rafter-secret` header | Live client config for Make scenarios |
| `/render-email` | POST | `x-rafter-secret` header | Render email template with merge fields |
| `/refresh-materials?uuid={uuid}` | GET | None | Sync SM8 materials to KV cache |
| `/resolve-slug/{slug}` | GET | None | Resolve URL slug → client UUID |
| `/client/{uuid}` | GET | None | Sanitised client KV record (no tokens) |
| `/materials/{uuid}` | GET | None | Cached materials from KV |
| `/photos/{uuid}` | GET | None | List photo categories from R2 |
| `/photo?uuid={uuid}&key={key}` | GET | None | Proxy photo from R2 |
| `/logo/{uuid}` | GET | None | Serve `clients/{uuid}/logo.{png,jpg,jpeg}` from R2 |
| `/brand/{key}` | GET | None | Serve `brand/{key}` from R2 publicly |
| `/sm8-staff?uuid={uuid}` | GET | None | List active SM8 staff (for UUID lookup) |
| `/sm8-search?uuid={uuid}&q={q}` | GET | None | Search SM8 companies (min 3 chars) |
| Cron `0 10 * * *` UTC | — | — | Nightly materials sync for all clients |

**Worker secrets** (set via `npx wrangler secret put <NAME> --name rafter-materials-sync`):

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `RAFTER_WORKER_SECRET` | Bearer token auth for `/store-token` (called by Make Account Discovery) |
| `RAFTER_INTERNAL_SECRET` | Header auth (`x-rafter-secret`) for `/client-config` and `/render-email` (called by Make Rafter Form) |
| `SERVICEM8_CLIENT_SECRET` | SM8 OAuth client secret — used for token refresh |

**`/store-token` request body:**
```json
{ "uuid": "...", "access_token": "...", "refresh_token": "...", "expires_at": "..." }
```

**`/client-config` response** (8 fields — `refresh_token` and full KV record NOT exposed):
```json
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "staff_uuid": "...",
  "email_template": "...",
  "company_name": "...",
  "phone": "...",
  "business_email": "...",
  "operator_email": "...",
  "logo_url": "..."
}
```

**`/render-email` request body:**
```json
{
  "uuid": "...",
  "client_name": "Sandra Dogny",
  "job_address": "87 Gyrfalcon Way, Doreen VIC 3754",
  "quote_ref": "Q-20260516-1247",
  "total": "254.10"
}
```
**`/render-email` response:**
```json
{ "html": "<rendered email body with all {merge_fields} substituted>" }
```

**Token refresh logic:** `refreshTokenIfNeeded()` — proactive, time-based (refreshes if token expires
within 5 minutes). Calls `https://go.servicem8.com/oauth/access_token` with `grant_type=refresh_token`.
Writes updated tokens directly to KV. Not reactive to 401s.

## Worker — rafter-pdf

**URL:** https://rafter-pdf.will-8e8.workers.dev  
**Location:** `workers/pdf/`

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/generate?mode=preview` | POST | Generate PDF, return binary blob for browser preview |
| `/generate?mode=submit` | POST | Generate PDF for Make to deliver to SM8 |

**Required wrangler.toml flags:**
```toml
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
```

**Font loading:** Google Fonts does NOT load in headless Chromium. Mulish 400/700 and Playfair
Display 600 must be inlined as base64 data URIs. Never reference Google Fonts CDN in PDF HTML.

## ServiceM8 API

**Base URL:** `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/`  
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`  
**Token endpoint:** `POST https://go.servicem8.com/oauth/access_token`  
**App ID:** 781230

**Current OAuth scopes:**
```
vendor vendor_logo read_staff read_inventory read_job_categories read_job_queues
manage_templates manage_badges read_tax_rates read_forms read_customers read_jobs publish_email
```

| SM8 Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| `/company.json?search={q}` | GET | Client search (min 3 chars, debounced 400ms) |
| `/staff.json` | GET | List staff |
| `/material.json` | GET | List materials |
| `/job.json` | POST | Create job — native Make module returns Job UUID directly |
| `/jobactivity.json` | POST | Create job note/activity |
| `/attachment.json` | POST | Create attachment record (step 1 of PDF delivery) |
| `/Attachment/{uuid}.file` | POST | Upload PDF binary (step 2 of PDF delivery) |
| `https://api.servicem8.com/platform_service_email` | POST | Send quote email to customer |

**SM8 email API headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
x-impersonate-uuid: {staff_uuid}
Content-Type: application/json
```
**SM8 email API body:**
```json
{
  "to": "{customer_email}",
  "subject": "Your quote from 2 Men and a Shovel – {quote_ref}",
  "htmlBody": "{rendered HTML from /render-email}",
  "regardingJobUUID": "{job_uuid}",
  "attachments": ["{attachment_uuid}"]
}
```

**SM8 Inbox API (VER-01 — CLOSED/INVALID):** The Inbox API has no file attachment support at
the API level. The `inboxmessage.json` schema has no file field. PDF delivery via Inbox is not
possible. Use the Attachment endpoint (two-step above) instead.

**Trial instance token:** Read from KV — `client:448e12a8-f7d9-4ace-b8c6-242bf678db3b` → `access_token`.  
Alternatively from Cloudflare dashboard → KV → RAFTER_CLIENTS.  
**ALWAYS use trial UUID for any test API call. Never the live UUID.**

# SECTION 2 — Client Config Reference

## KV record structure

**Key pattern:** `client:{uuid}`  
**KV namespace:** RAFTER_CLIENTS (`7c7ad02d8136452eb6d03d1af89a684f`)

All fields documented below. Fields marked [OAuth] are populated automatically by the OAuth flow
via `/store-token`. Fields marked [post-OAuth] must be set manually after OAuth completes.

| Field | Type | Source | Returned by | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `uuid` | string | SM8 / Prerequisites | `/client/{uuid}` | SM8 company/operator UUID |
| `company_name` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}`, `/client-config` | Display name e.g. "2 Men and a Shovel" |
| `branding.primary` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | Dark colour hex e.g. `#0D2E1C` |
| `branding.accent` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | Accent colour hex e.g. `#84B741` |
| `branding.background` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | Light bg hex e.g. `#ECF1E8` |

| `payment_thresholds` | object | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | Keys: `under_15k`, `between_15k_50k`, `over_50k`. Values: e.g. `"50/50"`, `"20/60/20"`, `"5/progress/final"` |
| `proposal_types` | string[] | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | e.g. `["LC", "GM"]` — abbreviations used in PDF cover title |
| `job_categories` | string[] | SM8 | `/client/{uuid}` | From SM8 Settings → Job Categories |
| `job_queues` | string[] | SM8 | `/client/{uuid}` | From SM8 Settings → Job Queues |
| `templates` | object[] | SM8 | `/client/{uuid}` | Array of `{"name": "TEMPLATE NAME"}` — synced from SM8 |
| `phone` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}`, `/client-config` | Business phone e.g. `"(03) 9013 6588"` |
| `business_address` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | Full address, newline between street and suburb line |
| `business_email` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}`, `/client-config` | Public contact email |
| `operator_email` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}`, `/client-config` | Email for operator notifications (Make Gmail module To field) |
| `abn` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | e.g. `"18 652 417 171"` |
| `bank_details` | object | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | Keys: `name`, `bsb`, `account` |
| `credentials` | object[] | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | Array of `{"name": "...", "detail": "..."}` — printed on PDF appendix |
| `terms_and_conditions` | string[] | Client | `/client/{uuid}` | Array of strings — printed on PDF appendix |
| `staff_uuid` | string | SM8 [post-OAuth] | `/client/{uuid}`, `/client-config` | Account owner SM8 UUID — used as `x-impersonate-uuid` in email API. Trial: `5ba57e76-53c0-4340-86ce-24244cfa725b` (Will Thurlow). Andy's live: obtain via `/sm8-staff` endpoint after OAuth. |
| `email_template` | string | Client | `/client/{uuid}`, `/client-config`, `/render-email` | HTML email body. Merge fields: `{client_name}`, `{job_address}`, `{quote_ref}`, `{total}`. `/render-email` substitutes these server-side. |
| `logo_url` | string | Derived | `/client/{uuid}`, `/client-config` | Public URL of client logo for form header and favicon. Trial: `https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/brand/rafter-logo.png`. Andy's live: `https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/logo/0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b` |
| `webhook_url` | string | Client | `/client-config` | Make Scenario 3 (Rafter Form) webhook URL. Required for submit mode — rafter-pdf reads this from KV; returns 400 if missing. Per-client, must be written to KV for each instance. |
| `access_token` | string | OAuth | `/client-config` only | SM8 Bearer token (NOT in `/client/{uuid}` — sanitised out) |
| `refresh_token` | string | OAuth | NOT exposed | SM8 refresh token — never returned by any endpoint |
| `expires_at` | string | OAuth | NOT exposed | ISO 8601 expiry timestamp |
| `token_updated_at` | string | OAuth | NOT exposed | ISO 8601 timestamp of last token write |

**Sanitised fields** (never returned by `/client/{uuid}`):
`access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`, `token_updated_at`

**`/client-config` fields** (returned to Make, auth required):
`access_token`, `staff_uuid`, `email_template`, `company_name`, `phone`, `business_email`,
`operator_email`, `logo_url`, `webhook_url`

## Trial instance known values (448e12a8...)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `uuid` | `448e12a8-f7d9-4ace-b8c6-242bf678db3b` |

| `templates` | 26 items (see KV record for names) |
| `proposal_types` | `["LC", "GM"]` |

## Supplementary KV key patterns

| Key pattern | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `client:{uuid}` | Full client config record |
| `materials:{uuid}` | Cached SM8 materials array (86400s TTL) |
| `slug:{slug}` | Maps URL slug → UUID e.g. `slug:andy` → `448e12a8-...` |

# SECTION 3 — Issue Tracker

Status as of 16 May 2026. Owner: Code = Claude Code; Will-Make = Will in Make UI; Will = Will manually.

## Bugs

| ID | Title | Status | Priority | Owner | Notes |
|----|-------|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| BUG-01 | Google Maps API key domain restriction | **Closed** | P1 | Will | `rafter.deepgreensea.au/*` added to Google Cloud Console authorised referrers. Also: site_address field mapping fixed in Make (was snake_case rename issue). |
| BUG-02 | Account Discovery Webhook Response returning "Accepted" not JSON | **Closed** | P1 | Will-Make | Webhook Response module body: `{"access_token": "{{2.body.access_token}}", "expires_in": {{2.body.expires_in}}}`. Content-Type: application/json. Status 200. |
| BUG-03 | OAuth token refresh logic not built | **Closed** | P1 | Code | `refreshTokenIfNeeded()` at `workers/materials-sync/index.js:83–137`. Proactive time-based refresh (within 5 min of expiry). Writes to KV directly. Not reactive to 401s. |
| BUG-04 | Job Note module — staff_uuid empty | **Closed** | P1 | Will-Make | Uses `3. Created by Staff UUID` from Create a Job module output dynamically. |
| BUG-05 | Job Note module — note field not populating | **Closed** | P1 | Will-Make | Mapped to `3. Job Description`. |
| BUG-06 | PDF not arriving in SM8 on submit | **Closed** | P1 | Code | PDF delivers via two-step Attachment endpoint. Confirmed working. |
| BUG-07 | SM8 client search too fuzzy | **Closed** | P2 | Code | Fixed in T1-F1. |
| BUG-08 | Make Rafter Form — existing client routing unconfirmed | **Closed** | P1 | Will-Make | Confirmed working end-to-end in T1-F1 acceptance test. |
| BUG-09 | Photos not appearing in PDF | **Closed** | P1 | Code | Fixed — R2 paths fetched and embedded. |
| BUG-10 | No spinner/disabled state on submit buttons | **Closed** | P1 | Code | Spinner + disabled state added. |
| BUG-11 | SM8 client search dropdown clipped | **Closed** | P1 | Code | Z-index and overflow fixed. |
| BUG-12 | `lineItems[]` array missing from payload | **Closed** | P1 | Code | Restored. Also fixed compositing regression on material search dropdown. |
| BUG-13 | PDF credentials block forced to wrong page | **Closed** | P1 | Code | Moved to forced-page-break appendix. |
| BUG-14 | PDF bank details missing | **Closed** | P1 | Code | Moved to financial summary section in body. |
| BUG-15 | PDF terms and conditions missing | **Closed** | P1 | Code | Added to appendix page. |

## Tech Debt

| ID | Title | Status | Priority | Owner | Notes |
|----|-------|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| DEBT-01 | Make reading tokens from Data Store (stale every hour) | **Closed** | P1 | Code + Will-Make | `/client-config` endpoint built, deployed. Module 35 in Rafter Form scenario calls it. Make Data Store for tokens is redundant. |
| DEBT-02 | Currency values not formatted to 2dp in payload | **Closed** | P2 | Code | `toFixed(2)` applied to all currency fields in `buildPayload()` in index.html. |
| DEBT-03 | `operator_email` hardcoded in Make Gmail module | **Closed** | P1 | Code + Will-Make | Code complete: operator_email in KV and /client-config. Make Gmail module To field updated to {{35.data.operator_email}} — confirmed working 16 May 2026. |

## Verifications

| ID | Title | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| VER-01 | SM8 Inbox API PDF attachment support | **Closed/Invalid** | — | SM8 Inbox API has no file attachment field at API level. Cannot attach PDFs to Inbox messages. PDF delivery via Attachment endpoint (already working) is the correct approach. |
| VER-02 | SM8 OAuth scope for Inbox write | **Closed/Invalid** | — | Moot — Inbox delivery abandoned (VER-01). `publish_inbox` scope not needed. |
| VER-03 | SM8 job creation response includes job UUID | **Closed** | — | Native Make SM8 module returns `Job UUID` directly as output field. Confirmed used by downstream modules. |

## Make UI tasks outstanding (Will-Make)

These cannot be done by Claude Code — they require Make UI configuration:

| Task | Description | Priority |
|------|-------------|---------|
| MAKE-01 | **CLOSED** — Gmail module To field updated to {{35.data.operator_email}}. Confirmed working 16 May 2026. | P1 |
| MAKE-02 | **CLOSED** — /render-email HTTP POST module added as Module 36 in Rafter Form scenario. Confirmed working 16 May 2026. | P1 |
| MAKE-03 | **CLOSED** — SM8 email module htmlBody updated to use /render-email response via JSON Create module (Module 37). Confirmed working 16 May 2026. | P1 |

# SECTION 4 — Decision Log

These are the settled threads from all Rafter conversations. Locked decisions are not reopened
without explicit Will sign-off.

| # | Workstream | Title | Status | Decision |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| D1 | Infrastructure | Photo hosting | **Locked** | Cloudflare R2, bucket `rafter-assets`. Zero egress. Path: `clients/{uuid}/photos/{category}/{filename}`. |
| D2 | Infrastructure | PDF generation | **Locked** | Browser Rendering API via Cloudflare Worker. Fonts inlined as base64 data URIs (Google Fonts doesn't load in headless Chromium). |
| D3 | Infrastructure | Client deduplication | **Locked (deferred)** | No dedup logic in Rafter. Operational fallback: SM8 dashboard → Merge Clients. |
| D4 | Infrastructure | Materials sync | **Locked** | KV cache, 24hr TTL (`materials:{uuid}`). Nightly cron 8pm AEST (10:00 UTC). Manual refresh endpoint on form. |
| D5 | Infrastructure | Quote amendments | **Locked (revised)** | Stateless — operator regenerates quote in Rafter and resubmits. SM8 Inbox API not viable (no attachment support). PDF delivers via Attachment endpoint to SM8 job. |
| D6 | Platform | Quote reference format | **Locked** | `Q-YYYYMMDD-HHMM` Melbourne timezone, generated at form load. Amendment suffix: `-v2`. |
| D7 | Platform | Template library | **Locked** | Per-client KV. SM8 `jobtemplate.json` returns name/UUID only — template content extracted manually and stored in KV. |
| D8 | Platform | Onboarding | **Locked** | Manual checklist (Track 1). Automated wizard deferred (Track 2). |
| D9 | Platform | PDF preview | **Locked** | "Preview Quote" button → Browser Rendering Worker → PDF in new tab. Non-destructive, no SM8 writes. |
| D10 | Platform | Supported devices | **Locked** | 768px minimum. Tablet landscape + desktop. Mobile out of scope. Touch-first. |
| D11 | Platform | HTML forms over Tally | **Locked** | Claude builds HTML forms. Fully customisable, hosted on Cloudflare Workers. No Tally dependency. |
| D12 | Platform | SM8 OAuth (Public App) | **Locked** | App ID 781230. Authorization code flow. Tokens stored in KV via `/store-token`. App secret never in browser or GitHub — stored in Make. |
| D13 | Platform | Multi-tenancy model | **Locked** | One Make scenario for all clients. `client_uuid` in webhook payload routes to correct KV config via `/client-config`. No separate scenario per client. |
| D14 | Platform | Agent architecture | **Locked** | Agent lives on Rafter/Will's side. SM8 is a dumb REST recipient of well-formed API calls. No dependency on SM8's MCP server. |
| D15 | Platform | Quote email delivery | **Locked** | SM8 `platform_service_email` API. `x-impersonate-uuid` for staff personalisation. From address: SM8's sending infrastructure. Two Way Email active — customer replies log to job diary. |
| D16 | Andy | Scope text model | **Locked** | Template-fill, not AI generation. SM8 job templates are boilerplate source (confirmed word-for-word in all 11 Andy proposals). AI reserved for site-specific caveats. |
| D17 | Andy | Proposal format | **Locked** | Section-based. Two types: LC (Landscape Construction) and GM (Garden Maintenance/Makeover). Section order fixed. Photos inline within sections. |
| D18 | Andy | Delivery as line items | **Locked** | Multiple delivery SKUs in SM8. Form presents contextually relevant options. Not a calculated field. |
| D19 | Andy | Payment schedule | **Locked** | Auto-calculated from job total. Thresholds from KV `payment_thresholds` field. |
| D20 | Andy | PDF is client document | **Locked** | Rafter-generated PDF is the client-facing quote artefact. SM8 job created at Quote status for backend record. SM8 Proposals feature not used. |
| D21 | Platform | `operator_email` config-driven | **Locked** | Per-client KV field. Returned by `/client-config`. Make Gmail module To field must use this, not hardcoded email. |
| D22 | Platform | SM8 MCP server | **Deferred** | Monitor only. SM8 MCP server at `developer.servicem8.com/mcp` assessed as too early. Not a build dependency. |

- [ ] Andy's branding assets confirmed (colours, fonts, logo file) — **Will**
- [ ] Andy's operator notification email confirmed (for `operator_email` field) — **Will**
- [ ] Andy's ABN confirmed (currently `18 652 417 171` — verify with Andy, one source shows `18 652 417 051`) — **Will**

## Step 1 — Create Andy's KV record

**Owner: Code.** Create `client:0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b` in KV namespace `7c7ad02d8136452eb6d03d1af89a684f`.

Leave token fields (`access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`, `token_updated_at`) as empty strings — populated by OAuth (Step 3).
Leave `staff_uuid` as empty string — populated in Step 5.
Leave `templates` as empty array — populated after materials sync (Step 6).

**Known values for Andy's record:**
```json
{
  "uuid": "0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b",
  "company_name": "2 Men and a Shovel",
  "branding": {
    "primary": "#0D2E1C",
    "accent": "#84B741",
    "background": "#ECF1E8",
    "heading_font": "Playfair Display",
    "body_font": "Mulish"
  },
  "r2_photo_path": "clients/0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b/photos/",
  "phone": "(03) 9013 6588",
  "business_address": "61 Aileen Avenue\nCaulfield South, VIC 3162",
  "business_email": "hello@2menandashovel.com",
  "abn": "[VERIFY WITH ANDY]",
  "bank_details": { "name": "2 Men and a Shovel", "bsb": "083-231", "account": "958330593" },
  "logo_url": "https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/logo/0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b",
  "webhook_url": "https://hook.eu1.make.com/oh8gh9i7cdadlmmcyh3ypeep1x1n9jd4"
}
```

**Logo:** The PDF Worker already reads `clients/{uuid}/logo.png` from R2. Verify Andy's logo is uploaded to `clients/0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b/logo.png` in R2.

**Slug:** Write `slug:andy` → `0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b` to KV (replaces trial mapping):
```
cd workers/materials-sync
npx wrangler kv key put "slug:andy" "0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b" --binding=RAFTER_CLIENTS --remote
```

- [x] KV record created and verified in Cloudflare dashboard — **Code**
- [x] `slug:andy` updated to live UUID — **Code**

## Step 2 — Upload Andy's logo to R2

**Owner: Will.** Upload the 2 Men and a Shovel logo PNG to:
`rafter-assets` R2 bucket → `clients/0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b/logo.png`

- [x] Logo uploaded to R2 — **Will**
- [x] Verify: `curl https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/logo/0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b` returns image — **Will**

## Step 3 — SM8 OAuth

**Owner: Will.** Andy must complete the OAuth flow, or Will on Andy's behalf using `will@deepgreensea.au`.

1. Navigate to `rafter.deepgreensea.au/setup`
2. Click **Connect ServiceM8**
3. Log in with Andy's SM8 credentials (or `will@deepgreensea.au` if Will has access)
4. SM8 consent screen shows all scopes — click **Allow**
5. `callback.html` shows "Setup complete"

Behind the scenes: callback.html → Make Account Discovery → SM8 token exchange → `/store-token` → KV updated.

- [x] OAuth completed without error — **Will**
- [x] Verify KV record has `access_token` and `expires_at` populated — **Will** (Cloudflare dashboard)

## Step 4 — Make Data Store record

**Owner: Will-Make.** *(Temporary workaround — DEBT-01 code is done but Make UI still reads from Data Store in some modules. Remove once all Make modules use `/client-config`.)*

Open Make → Data Stores → Rafter Tokens → Add record:
- `uuid`: `0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b`
- `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`: copy from KV record

- [x] Data Store record created with Andy's live UUID and tokens — **Will-Make**

## Step 5 — Staff UUID

**Owner: Code.** Obtain Andrew Little's SM8 staff UUID after OAuth.

```
curl "https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/sm8-staff?uuid=0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b"
```

Find the record for Andrew Little (Account Owner). Copy the `uuid` field.
Write `staff_uuid` into Andy's KV record via `--path` method.

Make Module 33 `x-impersonate-uuid` confirmed already set to `{{35.data.staff_uuid}}` — no change needed.

- [x] Andrew Little's staff UUID obtained (`fe62e877-7a15-4a31-aac7-f670c78ef0ab`) — **Code**
- [x] `staff_uuid` written to Andy's KV record — **Code**
- [x] Make SM8 email module `x-impersonate-uuid` confirmed using `{{35.data.staff_uuid}}` — **Will-Make**

## Step 6 — Materials sync

**Owner: Will.**

```
curl "https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/refresh-materials?uuid=0e604a45-84fd-4789-a2cb-662bcba51a8b"
```

Expected: `{"ok": true, "count": N, ...}` where N > 0.

- [x] Materials synced — 453 materials — **Will**

## Step 7 — Verification checklist

Work through each test in order. Do not mark passed until personally confirmed.

**Setup and auth**
- [ ] Form loads at `rafter.deepgreensea.au/andy` with "2 Men and a Shovel" in header — **Will**
- [ ] 2 Men and a Shovel logo appears in form header and browser tab favicon — **Will**
- [ ] Setup page loads at `rafter.deepgreensea.au/setup` — **Will**

**Form functionality**
- [ ] SM8 client search returns real Andy customers (type 3+ chars) — **Will**
- [ ] Google Maps autocomplete works in site address field — **Will**
- [ ] Materials load in line item search — **Will**
- [ ] Payment schedule auto-calculates from total — **Will**

**Submit Job Only** (no customer email)
- [ ] Job created in Andy's live SM8 with correct client, address, job description — **Will**
- [ ] PDF arrives in SM8 job diary as attachment — **Will**
- [ ] Quote reference (Q-YYYYMMDD-HHMM) appears — **Will**

**Submit and Send Quote** (with customer email)
- [ ] Job created in SM8 — **Will**
- [ ] PDF in job diary — **Will**
- [ ] Customer receives email from Andy's SM8 address with PDF attached — **Will**
- [ ] Operator notification email received at Andy's `operator_email` — **Will**

**Two-way email**
- [ ] Customer replies to quote email → reply appears in SM8 job diary — **Will**

## Step 8 — Post go-live

- [ ] Delete any test jobs and clients created during verification from Andy's live SM8 — **Will**
- [ ] Confirm `slug:andy` still resolves to live UUID — **Code**
- [ ] Update `rafter-continuation-prompt.md` with T1-F2 completion — **Will**
- [ ] Rotate `RAFTER_WORKER_SECRET` and `RAFTER_INTERNAL_SECRET` if they were ever in the trial environment chat history — **Code**

# SECTION 6 — Backlog

Items identified but not yet scheduled. All are post-T1-F2 unless noted.

## Make UI tasks (immediate — pre-T1-F2)

| ID | Task | Owner | Notes |
|----|------|-------|-------|
| MAKE-01 | Gmail module To field → `operator_email` from /client-config | Will-Make | DEBT-03 code done. Make UI pending. |
| MAKE-02 | Add `/render-email` HTTP module after Module 35 | Will-Make | Endpoint built and deployed. Module not yet in Make. |
| MAKE-03 | Update SM8 email module `htmlBody` to use `/render-email` response | Will-Make | Depends on MAKE-02. |
| MAKE-04 | Account Discovery `/store-token` UUID hardcoded to trial | Will-Make | UUID is hardcoded in Make — change to `{{2.body.company_uuid}}` or equivalent to support multi-client dynamically. |

## Platform backlog

| Item | Description | Priority | Phase |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Rafter Lite** | Rafter without SM8 — form generates PDF, emails to customer and operator, no SM8 job/client creation. Make scenario skips SM8 modules. Commercial model TBD. Architecturally straightforward. | P3 | Post-Andy demo |
| **Dev/prod Make separation** | Separate Make scenarios or Worker environments for development vs production. Currently one shared scenario, multi-tenant by `client_uuid`. | P3 | Platform |
| **Automated acceptance test suite** | Weekly cron, 7 assertions across SM8/Make/Rafter, emails Will on failure. Post-change regression + continuous monitoring. Claude Code or lightweight Python harness. | P3 | Track 2 |
| **Make log extraction** | Export Make execution logs via API for monitoring/debugging. | P3 | Platform |
| **Onboarding wizard** | Replace manual onboarding checklist with guided wizard in Rafter operator interface. | P3 | Track 2 |
| **Template editor** | Lightweight admin interface for editing KV templates without raw JSON edits. | P3 | Track 2 |
| **SM8 MCP server monitoring** | Monitor `https://developer.servicem8.com/mcp` for maturity. Not a build dependency. | Monitor | Platform |
| **Quote amendment workflow** | Operator regenerates quote and resubmits to SM8. Amendment format: `Q-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-v2`. SM8 Inbox path abandoned (VER-01 closed). | P2 | Post-T1-F2 |
| **Agentic onboarding** | Agent on Will's side structures SM8 REST API payloads for client onboarding. Iterative autonomy expansion — read-only first. | P3 | Long-term |
| **Photo gallery labelling** | Andy has ~80 unlabelled plant photos. Decision needed: comfortable scrolling or want labels. Ask before building. | P2 | Post-T1-F2 |
| **Line item delivery context** | Form presents contextually relevant delivery SKUs based on materials selected. | P2 | Post-T1-F2 |
| **Deduplication handling** | Client search before create. SM8 Merge Clients as operational fallback. | P3 | Track 2 |

## Andy open questions (ask before T1-F1 or T1-F2)

1. Payment schedule milestone descriptions — editable per quote or fixed?
2. Materials not in SM8 inventory — add to SM8 first, or ad-hoc line items?
3. Plants photos (~80, unlabelled) — comfortable scrolling or want labels?
4. Line item details (materials, quantities, prices) — internal only or show in client PDF?
5. ABN: `18 652 417 171` or `18 652 417 051` — confirm correct value.
6. Operator notification email for live instance — which address?

# SECTION 7 — Make Scenario Reference

**Make is UI-only — Claude Code cannot modify Make scenarios. Document required changes and hand to Will.**

## Scenario 1 — Account Discovery

**Purpose:** OAuth token exchange after SM8 login  
**Webhook URL:** `https://hook.eu1.make.com/38k3vwhijsfun40uu3pmk942gdjnvj32`

| Module | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Custom Webhook | Trigger. Receives POST `{"code": "..."}` from callback.html |
| 2 | HTTP → Make a request | POST `https://go.servicem8.com/oauth/access_token` (urlencoded). Body: `grant_type=authorization_code`, `client_id=781230`, `client_secret=[stored in Make]`, `code={{1.code}}`, `redirect_uri=https://rafter.deepgreensea.au/callback`. Returns `body.access_token`, `body.refresh_token`, `body.expires_in`. |
| 3 | Data Store | Add/Replace record to "Rafter Tokens". Fields: `uuid` (hardcoded `448e12a8-...`), `access_token={{2.body.access_token}}`, `refresh_token={{2.body.refresh_token}}`, `expires_at={{...}}`. **TODO MAKE-04:** Make UUID dynamic. |
| 4 | HTTP → Make a request | POST `https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/store-token`. Header: `Authorization: Bearer [RAFTER_WORKER_SECRET]`. Body: `{"uuid": "448e12a8-...", "access_token": "{{2.body.access_token}}", "refresh_token": "{{2.body.refresh_token}}", "expires_at": "..."}`. |
| 5 | Webhooks → Webhook Response | Status 200. Content-Type: application/json. Body: `{"access_token": "{{2.body.access_token}}", "expires_in": {{2.body.expires_in}}}`. **This returns the token to callback.html.** |

## Scenario 2 — Data Retrieval

**Purpose:** Pull SM8 account data immediately after OAuth (sends email to will@deepgreensea.au)  
**Webhook URL:** `https://hook.eu1.make.com/hao3fhj1n2d1il4bhkkabozjwl892ujt`

| Module | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Custom Webhook | Receives `{"access_token": "..."}` from callback.html |
| 3 | HTTP GET | `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/vendor.json` (company/vendor info) |
| 4 | HTTP GET | `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/staff.json` |
| 5 | HTTP GET | `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/material.json` |
| 6 | HTTP GET | `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/category.json` |
| 7 | HTTP GET | `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/queue.json` |
| 8 | HTTP GET | `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/documenttemplate.json` |
| 9 | HTTP GET | `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/badge.json` |
| 10 | HTTP GET | `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/taxrate.json` |
| 11 | Gmail → Send Email | To: `will@deepgreensea.au`. Subject: `ServiceM8 Account Discovery — {{3.data.name}}`. Body: labelled JSON blocks for all fetched data. |

All HTTP modules use `Authorization: Bearer {{1.access_token}}`.

## Scenario 3 — Rafter Form

**Purpose:** Process form submission — create SM8 job, attach PDF, send email to customer, notify operator

**Webhook payload fields from index.html:**
`mode`, `client_uuid`, `customer_email`, `send_email`, `quote_ref`, `proposal_type`,
`client_name`, `client_sm8_uuid`, `site_address`, `proposal_date`, `sections`,
`form_sections` (with line_items, photos), `lineItems[]`, `notes`, `subtotal`, `gst`,
`total`, `payment_schedule`, `bank_details`, `include_materials_appendix`, `pdf` (binary)

| Module | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Custom Webhook | Trigger. Receives form submission payload including binary PDF. |
| [2] | JSON Parse | Parses `1.payload` JSON string to expose `client_uuid` as selectable variable. |
| [new client branch] | Router / If-Else | If `client_sm8_uuid` is empty → Create a Client in SM8. Merge → Create a Job using new or existing UUID. |
| 3 | SM8 → Create a Job | Creates SM8 job. Returns `Job UUID`, `Created by Staff UUID`, `Generated Job ID`. Fields: `job_address={{1.site_address}}`, `job_description={{1.job_description}}`, `status=Quote`, `company_uuid={{resolved client uuid}}`. |
| [4] | SM8 → Create a Job Note | `job_uuid={{3.uuid}}`, `staff_uuid={{3.Created by Staff UUID}}`, `note={{1.job_description}}`. |
| [5] | SM8 → Create Attachment Record | `related_object=job`, `related_object_uuid={{3.uuid}}`, `attachment_name={{1.pdf.name}}`, `file_type=.pdf`. Returns attachment UUID. |
| [6] | Tools → Set Variable | Variable name: `attachment_uuid`. Value: `x-record-uuid` header from module [5] response. (`28.attachment_uuid` confirmed.) |
| [7] | HTTP → Upload PDF binary | POST `https://api.servicem8.com/api_1.0/Attachment/{{attachment_uuid}}.file`. Multipart body: file field with `1.pdf.data`, `fileName={{1.pdf.name}}`. |
| Router | Router | Splits into Route 1 (main chain) and Route 2 (customer email branch). |
| **Route 1** | | |
| [8] | SM8 → Create JobMaterial | Create line items in SM8 billing from `1.lineItems[]`. |
| [9] | Gmail → Send Email | Operator notification. To: `{{35.data.operator_email}}` (**MAKE-01 pending** — currently hardcoded `willthurlow73@gmail.com`). Subject: `Site Visit Quote - {{1.client_name}} - {{1.proposal_date}}`. Attachment: `{{1.pdf.data}}`. |
| **Route 2** | | Filter: `send_email == "true"` AND `customer_email` not empty. |
| 35 | HTTP GET `/client-config` | `https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/client-config?uuid={{client_uuid}}`. Header: `x-rafter-secret: [RAFTER_INTERNAL_SECRET]`. Returns `access_token`, `staff_uuid`, `email_template`, `company_name`, `phone`, `business_email`, `operator_email`, `logo_url`. |
| [36] | HTTP POST `/render-email` | `https://rafter-materials-sync.will-8e8.workers.dev/render-email`. Header: `x-rafter-secret`. Body: `{uuid, client_name, job_address, quote_ref, total}`. Returns `{"html": "..."}`. **MAKE-02 pending — not yet in Make.** |
| [37] | HTTP POST SM8 email | POST `https://api.servicem8.com/platform_service_email`. Headers: `Authorization: Bearer {{35.data.access_token}}`, `x-impersonate-uuid: {{35.data.staff_uuid}}`. Body: `{"to": "{{1.customer_email}}", "subject": "Your quote from 2 Men and a Shovel – {{1.quote_ref}}", "htmlBody": "{{36.html}}", "regardingJobUUID": "{{3.uuid}}", "attachments": ["{{28.attachment_uuid}}"]}`. **MAKE-03 pending** — currently `htmlBody` is inline template, not from `/render-email`. |

# Appendix — Constraints and Toolchain Notes

## Non-negotiable constraints

1. **Trial instance only** until T1-F2 explicit sign-off. Andy's live UUID (`0e604a45-...`) must not be used in any development or test.
2. **No client UUID, credential, or client-specific value hardcoded** in platform files. All config from KV.
3. **Rafter is stateless** — no quote database. Quotes live in SM8 only.
4. **`job_description` is append-only** with delimiter markers. Never overwrite.
5. **Agent on Rafter side only.** SM8 is a dumb REST recipient.
6. **768px minimum.** Touch-first. Mobile phone out of scope.
7. **No assumptions.** Flag for verification if not confirmed in this file.

## Toolchain notes

- **Wrangler v4 KV list** returns `[]` — use Cloudflare REST API or dashboard for key listing.
- **KV writes from PowerShell** corrupt JSON. Always use `--path <file>` with a UTF-8 JSON file.
- **Workers auto-deploy disabled** (build command = `exit 0`). Deploy manually from `workers/<name>/`.
- **Google Fonts** do not load in headless Chromium (rafter-pdf Worker). All fonts must be inlined as base64 data URIs.
- **SM8 token endpoint:** `https://go.servicem8.com/oauth/access_token` (not `app.servicem8.com` — that URL is wrong).
- **RAFTER_INTERNAL_SECRET value:** `R@ftCleanerTetr15Ren` (stored as Wrangler secret on `rafter-materials-sync`). Rotate before T1-F2 if this has appeared in conversation history.
- **RAFTER_WORKER_SECRET:** Rotated 17 May 2026 — old value exposed in session. New value set via wrangler; Will must update Make Account Discovery Module 5 Bearer token to match.

## Claude Chat / Claude Code split

**Claude Code owns:** File reads/writes, Worker deploys, KV reads/writes, API test calls, any task requiring execution.

**Claude Chat owns:** Architecture decisions, Make configuration (UI-only), bug triage and prioritisation, continuation prompt and issue tracker.

**Handoff format** (Chat → Code):
```
TASK: [one line]
FILE: [exact path or N/A]
ENDPOINT: [if API call]
INPUT: [exact values]
SUCCESS CONDITION: [what done looks like]
CONTEXT: See CLAUDE.md
```

## PDF design spec (locked — T1-D1 complete)

**Cover page:**
1. Header (every page): phone left (lime `#84B741`) · total right (lime) · thin rule
2. Logo from R2 left · business address/ABN right
3. "PREPARED FOR" lime uppercase · client name large bold · full address
4. Meta block right-aligned: Date / Reference / Total — lime label + Mulish 400 value. No proposal number.
5. Horizontal rule
6. Job title Playfair lime: `{type} — {street}, {suburb}` — no state, no country, one line

**Sections:** Playfair 600 ALL CAPS dark green heading · item name Mulish 700 + price right-aligned · rule · scope Mulish 400 · asterisk notes `#999`. Photos inline within section.

**Financial summary** (after all work sections): 1.5px divider · soft-green box with subtotal/GST/total → payment schedule → bank details.

**Appendix page** (forced page break): "You Can Rely On 2 Men and a Shovel" credentials block + T&Cs. Single A4 page.

**Footer:** page number right only, every page. No URL, no timestamp.

**Typography:**
- Playfair Display 600: section headings (ALL CAPS), block headings, job title
- Mulish 700: item names, prices
- Mulish 400: everything else
- All numbers in Mulish — no Playfair numerals
- Fonts: inlined as base64 data URIs (Google Fonts will NOT load in headless Chromium)
